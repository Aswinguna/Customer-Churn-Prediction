An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts customer churn for a telecom/SaaS business. The project covers the full ML lifecycle — data generation, feature engineering, multi-model training, SHAP explainability, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn is one of the most costly problems in subscription businesses. Acquiring a new customer is 5–7× more expensive than retaining one. This system gives customer success and retention teams a **real-time risk score** for each customer, along with the specific factors driving that risk — so they can act before the customer leaves.

## 🔍 Key Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Multi-model comparison** | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost evaluated on ROC-AUC and PR-AUC |
| **SHAP explainability** | Per-customer feature contributions — not just a black-box score |
| **Feature engineering** | Derived signals: `charges_per_month`, `num_services`, `is_long_term`, `has_support` |
| **Imbalanced classes** | Handled via `scale_pos_weight` and `class_weight="balanced"` |
| **Interactive dashboard** | Streamlit app with live predictions and visual explanations |

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.84 | ~0.62 |
| Random Forest | ~0.91 | ~0.74 |
| **XGBoost** ✓ | **~0.93** | **~0.78** |

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Month-to-month contracts and electronic check payment are the strongest churn predictors
- Long-tenure customers with online security and tech support have significantly lower churn rates
- XGBoost with `scale_pos_weight` handles class imbalance better than oversampling on this dataset
- SHAP tree explainer is fast enough for real-time per-customer inference
